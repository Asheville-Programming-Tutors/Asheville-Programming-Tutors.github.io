## Experience Timeless Programming Lessons Today

Learn to program computers with us.  From spreadsheets to machine learning, we can help you make progress on your programming journey.

Our instructors provide instruction, mentorship, and lessons that are: technology, architecture, and language agnostic using timeless principles.  These principles will make you more useful as an engineer, computer end user, or business leader interested in improving their know-how of software and computational tools as we move into the 21st century.

## Let's Get Started 

When you reach out to us we will send you a questionnaire to assess your familiarity with computers, what kind of technologies or path you’re looking to explore, your comfort level and previous experience with programming languages, and (most importantly) your personal goals.

After this, we will set up a free assessment and lesson where a qualified instructor will review the questionnaire with you, conduct a short assessment on the current skills and abilities you possess today, and create a mastery based action plan for acquiring the skills and tools you need to succeed.

## Learning By Doing

Once we have these goals and a plan we will focus on **teaching by doing**.  Things like computer science theory, programming paradigms, algorithms are important (even more so the further you go) but the primary mission of our instruction is to actively learn how to create, use, and/or fix actual software and systems.  Things that will help you **get stuff done**, which we find is the primary characteristic of computer masters in the real world.

A basic lesson will consist of:
1. Explanations or introductions to topics/skills lasting no more than 30 minutes.  This is to provide background, familiarity, and primary motivations for mastering the topic/skill and how it all fits into the bigger picture.
2. Following that, the next 30-60 minutes will be based upon:
    - Applications of that principle or topic created for the student to actively explore the concepts presented.
    - Pair programming/troubleshooting on any problem or software the student is currently working on.
    - Or a variety of code “katas” (short problems with well defined solutions) or applied simple problems designed to help ingrain skills into the student.
3. The final part of the lesson will consist of discussing goals, practice problems or homework (if the student requests it), and where to find more information about what was covered for the next lesson.

> These small lessons will exist within the context of whatever goal the student is attempting to achieve.  Certifications or coursework can be accomodated or we can just help you make progress on your journey to "build an app".

Using this method of instruction, the student will slowly but steadily master the topics in a concrete way, while giving the chance to freely explore with an experienced instructor who can help work through or smooth the road of the student while learning how to solve problems.

Written assessments and feedback will be provided from time to time and the student must practice between sessions, but the primary goal is always, *How comfortable is the student in using the computer to solve any computational challenge that comes up?*  In our experience, this is the **primary** differentiator between the great and the average developer.

## We Are Different

* It's long [been known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem) that personalized instruction using a mastery based approach helps students and practitioners learn skills faster than students in the classroom.  A tutor can get you to where you want to go faster than a university, an academic course, a bootcamp, or online tutorial. 
*  Unlike the courses listed above, we don’t focus on one particular technology stack, one language, one operating system, or even programming paradigm **for all students**.  We create lessons utilizing timeless programming concepts and principles that can be applied **wherever** the student wants to go while directly learning the languages, technologies, and skills needed to succeed.
* Unlike courses or bootcamps, a personalized instructor can schedule lessons on your timeframe flexibly.  When you have a day job it can be a struggle to get to classes in a typical academic setting.  Morning and evening classes at a particular time can cut into the more important areas of your life.  At APT we will schedule lessons when it's appropriate for **you** although slots run out pretty fast so be sure to schedule today.
