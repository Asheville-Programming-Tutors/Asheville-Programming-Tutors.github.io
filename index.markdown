## What Asheville Programming Tutors Provides

Learn to program computers, build and fix the software that runs our world, and the principles and processes that advanced engineers use directly from experienced practitioners.  Whether you’re a day zero beginner or a programmer with years of experience, we can provide instruction, mentorship, and lessons to achieve your goals.


Our instruction is tailored toward learning the general skills needed to succeed at software engineering and/or programming, while working directly on the problems that interest you, on your time frame.  Contrast with generalized bootcamps or traditional academic instruction and you’ll clearly see the benefits in time, interest, and utility today.

## The Process

### Becoming a Student

1. Fill out a questionnaire regarding:
   1. Your familiarity and comfort with computers and programming.
   2. Your experience with computers and/or programming.
   3. Your goals of programming instruction.
   4. Any interests or domains that particularly move you.
      1. Music/art
      2. Robotics
      3. Web development
      4. Systems software
      5. Security
      6. Data science/machine learning
      7. Other
2. We will set up a *free* assessment and evaluation session to help determine your skill set and abilities across multiple different dimensions of the creation/modification of software.
3. Our tutors will then begin to design lessons and sessions tailored to you

### Learning

* Our lessons will focus on actual programming and not just theory.  That is, every lesson will comprise actual programming with the help of a teacher.  That is every lesson will be composed of:
    + Explanations or introductions to topics that will help you learn the principles of programming from the ground up at whatever skill level you possess.
    + Applications of that principle or topic on a problem or software that the student would actually like to build.  The teacher will help a student walk through that principle or problem to create working software.  This will comprise at least half the lesson.
    + Practice problems can be provided or more appropriately, goals for the student to explore on their own time will be discussed that can be brought to the next lesson to be reviewed or expanded on in the next lesson.
* Between each session the student can and should practice and explore within these goals or practice problems
* Every so often a full assessment will be provided to help the understand where they need work and where they’ve advanced in skill.
* However, the primary assessment for the student should always be the perceived comfort they have in solving the problems they want to build and the software that they create and modify.  The ability to create useful software that runs in the real world will always be the primary criteria of assessing skill in programming.

### What separates us from other ways of learning to program

* Its long [been known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem) that personalized tutoring using mastery based learning helps students and practitioners learn skills at a significantly faster pace and to a significantly faster degree than students in generalized academic settings.  This is why a tutor can get you to where you want to go faster than a course, bootcamp, or online tutorial.
* There are new tools and programming languages invented every day.  There are programming languages that most people don’t even recognize as programming languages tacked onto other applications that people are using without realizing.  There is no way any one course, programming language, or tool will serve you for your whole career in any domain you wish to work in.  Only by learning the timeless principles and art will you be able to adapt to this changing world.
* You’re busy, it's hard to block out 12 weeks for a bootcamp or years for the university courses you need to be able to make software today.  Studying via books or online tutorials can give you some of this flexibility but then you lose the intelligent teacher or guide that can move you past the difficulties encountered when reality diverges from the book or tutorial.  Personalized instruction can work on your timeline at your speed.
